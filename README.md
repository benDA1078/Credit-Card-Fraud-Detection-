# Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Source found on Kaggle *will procide a link*. This is just a small little project as I continue to expand my knowledge for R Programming. The bases of this project is to answer the following questions: 
1. What are the characteristics of fraudulent transactions? What features or patterns can we identify in past data that are associated with fraud? 
2. How can we measure the performance of our model? What metrics can we use to evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness? 
3.  How can we improve the modelâ€™s performance? What techniques can we use to tune its parameters and optimize its performance?
